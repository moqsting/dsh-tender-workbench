# dsh-tender-workbench 0.4.0 release checklist

- Version: **0.4.0**
- Release date: 2026-09-05
- Status: **published**
- Release commit: `5f326db258b1f4b8ed1dd27861017c3d3d6471d5`
- Git tag: `v0.4.0`
- npm publication: `dsh-tender-workbench@0.4.0` (`latest`)
- GitHub Release: <https://github.com/duhu2000/dsh-tender-workbench/releases/tag/v0.4.0>

## Scope

Version 0.4.0 promotes the complete 0.3.0 beta workflow to the stable npm channel. It includes the Session-scoped query, deterministic rule screening, bounded Agent analysis, explicit human review, and immutable Excel/PDF delivery already represented by the V2 contracts. This release adds repeatable documentation, packaging, CI, and OIDC publication gates; it does not migrate the workflow or Artifact schema used by 0.3.0-beta.1.

## Compatibility and installation

- Node.js: `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`
- Package manager: `pnpm@11.7.0`
- DeepSeek Harness public packages: `>=0.1.1-rc.2 || >=0.1.2-0`
- `dsh-mcp-connector`: `>=0.2.31`
- `dsh-better-sidebar`: `>=0.17.1 || >=0.18.0-0`
- Required MCP tools: `mcp__qcc-tender__search_tenders` and `mcp__qcc-tender__search_proposed_projects`

Install `dsh-tender-workbench@0.4.0` together with compatible Provider plugins, then fully restart the Web profile. Missing required services, incompatible Better Sidebar capabilities, unavailable MCP tools, or non-JSONL Session persistence fail explicitly.

Unchecked items are pending and must not be reported as completed.

## Local validation record

Validated on 2026-09-05 with pnpm 11.7.0:

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`: passed with the checked-in lockfile and `allowBuilds` policy.
- `pnpm run check`: passed, including 207 passing tests and 1 intentional skip across 40 test files.
- Package whitelist: passed with 169 public files and no source, test, script, cache, credential, or private Artifact paths.
- Clean-install smoke test: passed after supplying the same DSH Host peer baseline used by development; the Host entry exported `apply` and `inject`, package metadata reported 0.4.0, and the Client bundle registered with the module loader.

The ordinary npm peer auto-installer currently reports an upstream DSH peer-version conflict between the connector and UI layout packages. The production DSH plugin manager supplies the Host peer set, so the isolated smoke test installs the tarball with peer auto-installation disabled and then injects the compatible 0.1.1-rc.2 Host baseline explicitly. The build also reports an upstream missing source-map warning from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives`; generated package source maps are present and the gate passes.

## Publication outcome

- `main` CI run 33946403394 passed on Linux Node 22, Linux Node 24, and Windows Node 24.
- Tag `v0.4.0` is annotated and resolves to release commit `5f326db258b1f4b8ed1dd27861017c3d3d6471d5`.
- The tag workflow passed its install, tag/version, test, build, documentation, and package gates. npm then returned `E404` because the Trusted Publisher association was not active for this package, so the workflow did not publish and did not create the GitHub Release.
- After confirming that 0.4.0 was absent from the registry, npm owner `duhu2000` used the approved browser-authenticated manual fallback to publish the same reviewed package. No second publish was attempted after success.
- Registry verification reports `latest` as 0.4.0, 169 files, SHA-1 `5b493bfe7577d9c0bc2bd0c039c10a227b393935`, and integrity `sha512-NeYsxbQlp7LKCOaevCFBuxZl0vjhuWgYwD3pbL/MNZYjuozLiGdErOhy+wpjBjbqrlidfy4OLx1DcE99gMBxvw==`.
- A fresh public-registry download and clean installation passed the Host entry, package metadata, and Client module-loader registration smoke tests.
- GitHub Release `v0.4.0` was created from the existing tag after npm publication and is neither draft nor prerelease.

The manual fallback cannot claim npm Trusted Publishing provenance. Configure the npm package's Trusted Publisher association for `duhu2000/dsh-tender-workbench` and `.github/workflows/release.yml` before the next release, then verify it with a new version rather than reusing `v0.4.0`.

## Publication procedure

1. Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` using pnpm 11.7.0.
2. Run `pnpm run check` and the clean tarball installation/import smoke test.
3. Commit only the reviewed 0.4.0 release files and push `main`.
4. Wait for all required CI jobs to pass.
5. Create annotated tag `v0.4.0` on the pushed release commit and push the tag.
6. The tag workflow verifies `v${package.version}`, reruns the complete gates, publishes with npm OIDC Trusted Publishing and provenance, then creates the GitHub Release.
7. Verify npm version, dist-tags, repository, maintainers, tarball metadata/file list, clean installation/import, Git commit/tag, and GitHub Release state.

## Security

- Never store or print npm tokens, GitHub tokens, QCC credentials, source datasets, real business evidence, or Session-private Artifacts.
- The npm package must exclude `src`, `tests`, `scripts`, `.github`, `resources`, caches, local evidence, and environment files.
- Runtime QCC access remains customer-authorized through the connector; this repository does not own or proxy credentials.
- pnpm's `allowBuilds` policy explicitly keeps the indirect `node-pty` native build script disabled because this package does not use its binary at runtime or in the release gates.

## Rollback

- Before the tag is pushed: delete only the local tag if necessary, fix the release commit, and rerun all gates.
- After the tag is pushed but before npm publication: stop the failing workflow, fix forward with a new patch version and tag, and do not reuse a public tag.
- After npm publication: never overwrite or unpublish 0.4.0. Mark the affected version if necessary, publish a corrected patch version, and use an ordinary revert commit for source rollback.
- Deployment rollback target: reinstall `dsh-tender-workbench@0.3.0-beta.1` and fully restart the profile.
