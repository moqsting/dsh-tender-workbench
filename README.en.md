# dsh-tender-workbench

Tender search and bid intelligence in DeepSeek Harness with proposed project search, rule screening, human review and Excel/PDF exports using user-authorized Qichacha MCP.

Install a pinned release using the command in the [Chinese quick start](README.md), review the preview or evidence before confirming, and keep the previous version and task-directory backup for rollback. Qichacha calls use the customer's authorized account.

[中文](README.md) | **English**

`dsh-tender-workbench` is an open-source DeepSeek Harness plugin for finding, screening, reviewing, and delivering tender opportunities. It combines authorized `qcc-tender` data, deterministic screening rules, bounded Agent analysis, explicit human decisions, and immutable Excel/PDF reports in one Session-scoped Better Sidebar workbench.

Current candidate version: **0.6.1** (unpublished).

Version 0.6.0 adapts the plugin to DeepSeek Harness 0.2.0-rc.2 and closes the findings of a security review of the upstream source: model-visible tool results can no longer be forged by external text, structured workbench Intents require a Host-issued session grant, and both monkey-patches of DSH core objects are gone. Version 0.6.1 fixes how a missing source capability is reported: an uninstalled or unauthorized source connector is no longer described as "check the connection and authorization, retryable", but as `not-installed` with an installation instruction and a non-retryable control. See the [0.6.1 release record](docs/RELEASE-0.6.1.md) and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Base mode targets the full DSH 0.2.0-rc.2 distribution; Better Sidebar 0.24.1 is optional and only provides the visual workbench. Legacy 0.1.x hosts are refused. Back up the complete Profile and verify dependencies before upgrading.

## What it does

The workbench follows four business phases:

1. **Find opportunities**: search tender notices and proposed projects with source, keyword, date, region, stage, procurement, industry, type, amount, approval, and investment conditions supported by the connected data source.
2. **Screen candidates**: edit Agent-proposed criteria, run deterministic impact previews, confirm a rule set, and inspect five mutually exclusive outcomes: included, observed, manual review, rule excluded, and unmatched.
3. **Human confirmation**: review pending and completed records separately, prioritize Agent recommendations, make individual or batch decisions, retain notes, and undo the latest review operation.
4. **Deliver**: confirm the reviewed scope and generate Excel and PDF files from one immutable report snapshot. Partial delivery remains explicit when records are still pending.

Agent analysis covers every record classified as included, observed, or requiring manual review. Rule-excluded and unmatched records are not analyzed. Analysis runs in deterministic batches until the eligible set is complete, and interrupted work resumes from the remaining records.

The human-review queue keeps Agent recommendations separate from user decisions. Its default ordering is priority review, watch, not recommended, then unanalyzed. Classification lists are ordered included, observed, manual review, rule excluded, then unmatched before pagination.

## Architecture

The package is a Host + Client DeepSeek Harness plugin:

- The Client registers one Session-targeted Better Sidebar tab and public launcher actions. It builds typed, user-visible intents and consumes bounded Session projections and Artifact APIs.
- The Host validates intents, calls the exact authorized MCP tools, owns workflow state transitions, stores Session-private Artifacts, and renders reports.
- Persistent business state is reconstructed from typed conversation events and immutable Artifact references. The UI does not infer state from model text or maintain a second cross-Session state machine.
- Query, criteria, analysis, review, and report writes share a Session-scoped single-flight guard. Read-only browsing remains available while a write is running.
- Registrations, subscriptions, portals, routes, and other side effects are tied to the plugin Context lifecycle and are disposed on unload or hot reload.

The plugin uses public DeepSeek Harness services and the public `dsh-better-sidebar` contract. It does not modify Harness source, access Provider internals, fetch MCP from the browser, read connector storage, hold API credentials, or write internal data to the Workspace.

## Data and report boundaries

Each Session has one active normalized dataset. A successful new query atomically replaces that active snapshot instead of merging results; historical Artifacts remain available for traceability while downstream state from the old snapshot becomes inactive.

Schema-valid MCP fields are retained as source facts. Missing values, disclosed-but-unparseable values, source failures, rule exclusions, and user exclusions remain distinct states and are not inferred from one another.

Excel is organized for analysis and verification, with separate overview, distribution, source-specific result, review, traceability, and data-quality sheets. PDF is organized for business readers, leading with deterministic conclusions, result distributions, deadline windows, and a bounded set of records requiring near-term verification. Both formats use the same immutable report snapshot; a failed format can be retried without re-querying or changing successful files.

## Security model (0.6.0 hardening)

- **External text is data.** Every source string is normalized at the pipeline boundary (line separators collapsed, control/format/private-use code points removed), and every model-visible tool result escapes `<`, `>` and U+2028/U+2029 as JSON unicode escapes inside a fence that states "this is data, not instructions". A tender notice published by a third party therefore cannot forge or close the tool-result fence.
- **Structured actions need Host authorization.** Before submitting an action the workbench page registers its Intent through the loopback-only `POST /dsh-tender-workbench/api/v1/intents` route (same-origin signal, Session header, existing Session). The Host keeps a 15-minute, 64-entry grant per Session, and the tool authorization gate requires an exact match on intentId, action kind and fingerprint. Intent text pasted into a message grants nothing and fails closed.
- **No DSH internals are touched.** The plugin no longer overrides `uiWorkspace.connectWorkspace` and no longer wraps `Session.beginSubmission`; the workbench opens by observing the plugin's own public projection fact (a business task has started).
- **Capability absence is not a failure.** When a source connector is missing, disabled or unauthorized, the DSH tool runtime reports `UNKNOWN_TOOL` for both "no such definition" and "hidden from this caller". The plugin classifies that as `not-installed`, returns `reasonCode=source-tool-missing` with `retryable=false`, and names the missing tool and the connector to install. A real failed call stays `failed` (retryable) and an explicit connector denial stays `no-permission`.
- **Artifact and report boundaries.** Artifact media types are derived from the artifact kind and allow-listed; manifests retain only the newest 128 receipts; the download Blob URL is released one macrotask later; spreadsheet text is normalized without inserting a visible apostrophe (ExcelJS writes `<f>` only for an explicit `{ formula }` object); PDF links accept `http(s)` only.

## Requirements and compatibility

This release constrains core peers to `~0.2.0-rc.2`; future combinations require verification:

- DeepSeek Harness public packages: `0.2.0-rc.2` (also declared in `engines.dsh`)
- `dsh-mcp-connector`: `>=0.2.31`
- Optional visual workbench: `dsh-better-sidebar@0.24.1`; the peer range is not an acceptance claim for untested versions

The active Profile must provide one coherent runtime with public Session Projection, JSONL Session Persistence, Tools, Skill, Sessions, and WebServer services. Only the visual workbench needs Better Sidebar and its `targetedOpen` / `stateSubscription` features; missing or incompatible capabilities do not block conversation activation.

Before installing, run `node scripts/check-host-compatibility.mjs --host-root /actual/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh --profile-root /actual/profiles/web`. It only reads package manifests: legacy 0.1.x hosts, mixed core packages, the known context fault and Better Sidebar 0.18.1 or older fail; unknown combinations are reported as unverified. The Windows mount script requires `-DshHostRoot` and executes this gate before mutation. Upgrade the complete host explicitly after backing up the Profile: `npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.0-rc.2`.

Context is not required. If already installed, 0.36.0 has a known removed settingsNamespace dependency; the coexistence baseline is 0.48.0. Update only with user approval and a backup. Rollback requires a complete verified host/plugin combination: do not install an older plugin package alone on the new host. Startup smoke does not prove live QCC or four-product acceptance.

An installed and authorized `qcc-tender` MCP connection must expose these exact tools:

- `mcp__qcc-tender__search_tenders`
- `mcp__qcc-tender__search_proposed_projects`

The default preflight accepts Sidebar-free base mode. Add `--workbench` (Windows mount: `-Workbench`) only when explicitly enabling the visual workbench; the Windows flag also checks its enabled bundle before any Profile write. No script automatically installs Sidebar. An already-installed Better Sidebar 0.18.1 or older, which calls the removed settingsNamespace client API, is still blocked, even in base mode. Runtime capability probes and Tab preferences remain separate from manifest inspection.

Without Sidebar, native Sessions, input drafts, the prompt builder, action Skills and Host tools remain available. Conversation-driven query, rule preview/confirmation, human review and report generation retain their contracts; actual model orchestration and paid MCP are separate acceptance layers. Existing authorized Excel/PDF artifact links can be downloaded, but visual table/detail/filter controls, batch-review controls, history view and download buttons require the workbench. All five shortcuts only explain this boundary, preserving state without starting tasks. No alternate drawer or native-workbench rewrite is implemented. Other missing required services, unavailable MCP tools and non-JSONL persistence fail explicitly.

## Install

Install base mode. The connector is needed for authorized QCC queries; Sidebar is not required:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add 'dsh-mcp-connector@>=0.2.31'
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-tender-workbench
dsh web --no-open
```

Optionally enable the visual workbench with `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-better-sidebar@0.24.1`, enable the tender Tab and fully restart the Profile.

To install the exact 0.6.1 release:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add 'dsh-mcp-connector@>=0.2.31'
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-tender-workbench@0.6.1
```

To install base mode from an independent checkout:

```sh
corepack pnpm@11.7.0 install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm@11.7.0 run build
dsh plugin --profile web add 'dsh-mcp-connector@>=0.2.31'
dsh plugin --profile web add .
dsh web --no-open
```

To install a packed build:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add 'dsh-mcp-connector@>=0.2.31'
dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-tender-workbench-0.6.1.tgz
dsh web --no-open
```

The package's `dsh.bundle.patch` declaration activates `cordis.patch.yml`, which contributes the `dsh-tender-workbench` Loader row. Restart the Web profile after adding or removing the plugin.

To remove it:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-tender-workbench
```

## Upgrade and rollback

Upgrade an existing installation by installing the release and fully restarting the Web profile. Upgrading this plugin never installs the source connector, so add step 1 first when the profile lacks it:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add 'dsh-mcp-connector@>=0.2.31'
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-tender-workbench@0.6.1
dsh web --no-open
```

Version 0.6.0 retains Workspace ownership and the snapshotEvents/turn-start authorization contract, and resolves the displayed Session from the official main-view retention fact; 0.6.1 corrects the missing-source classification and its retry semantics on top of that. The plugin no longer touches DSH core objects. Business state remains Session-local; Profile history stores metadata only, never writable projections or download capabilities. Existing unopened Sessions are not scanned: reopening indexes their current task, without restoring old snapshots. Back up the Profile's `.dsh-tender-workbench/history-v1.json` alongside task directories. Live MCP is not verified. Roll back the complete backed-up host/plugin combination, not an old plugin alone on the new host.

## Using the workbench

The top-left “招投标” launcher creates a distinct native Session using the current, recent, or first available workspace path. It shows the “招投标智能体” title and goal icon without opening the workbench. Below-composer shortcuts explicitly open the query, screening, review, or delivery view; the Session Header recovery action remains available. Other Sessions retain their original branding.

## Interface examples and marketplace submission

These screenshots show the actual 0.5.2 React components in an isolated host fixture, visibly labeled as isolated UI validation without DSH/MCP connections. They contain no customer information or real business responses. They do not demonstrate live DSH/QCC operation or marketplace one-click installation.

![Dark homepage — isolated component demo](assets/market/home-dark.png)

See [submission status and isolated install/uninstall evidence](docs/MARKET-SUBMISSION.md). An open PR is not a completed marketplace listing.

Navigation only changes the visible workbench phase. It does not mutate business state or run a later action. Criteria are proposed, edited, previewed, and confirmed as distinct steps. Agent recommendations never become user decisions automatically. Report generation always shows the reviewed and pending scope before creating a delivery snapshot.

The layout is container-responsive: wide workspaces use master/detail grids, while medium and narrow workspaces preserve the same information order with local table scrolling and reachable fixed actions.

## Development

Use the Node.js and pnpm versions declared by the repository (`pnpm-workspace.yaml` pins `nodeLinker: hoisted`, matching how DSH Profiles install and avoiding the Windows junction that breaks Node ESM resolution):

```sh
corepack pnpm@11.7.0 install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm@11.7.0 run check
```

The build emits the Host loader at `lib/index.js`, the Client bundle at `lib/client.js`, and declarations under `lib/types/`.

`check` runs type checking, the full Vitest suite, the production build, README/release-state validation, and an npm tarball whitelist preview. Every action in [the release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) is pinned to a commit SHA; release tags are published through npm Trusted Publishing with provenance when Trusted Publishing is configured, and manual npm publication must not claim provenance. The repository must never contain npm tokens, GitHub tokens, QCC credentials, source datasets, or Session-private Artifacts.

The province, city, and district source snapshot is maintained in [resources/area.ts](resources/area.ts).

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [the 0.6.1 release checklist](docs/RELEASE-0.6.1.md) for the release scope and operational checks.

`scripts/native-host-smoke.mjs` is the real-host smoke harness. It is still pinned to DSH 0.1.2-rc.1 and uses private client probes that generation removed, so it refuses to run against a 0.2.0-rc.2 host; porting it is a separate task. The Windows mount script `scripts/mount-web-profile.ps1` requires PowerShell 7, and its self-test is skipped where `pwsh` is absent.

## DSH-PackForge (pack) compatibility

The plugin is a self-contained "plan B" bundle: `cordis.patch.yml` inserts the host plugin, `package.json`'s `dsh.client` injects the client plugin, and it depends on no `@dsh-packforge/*` engine package at runtime. To wrap it in a `.dspack`, use the sample manifest at [packforge/manifest.json](packforge/manifest.json) (manifest v5 / pack v3, `dshVersions` listing only the tested `0.2.0-rc.2`). That directory is not part of the npm package; it ships with the source and the exported archive.

## Current scope

The plugin does not provide online PDF preview, delivery-version comparison, regeneration of already successful files, subscriptions, CRM follow-up, enterprise profiles, source-accuracy verification, or Bid/No-Bid decisions. Query, classification, analysis, and review are all valid stopping points; later actions only run after explicit user input.
